    <h4>As the old saying states, two heads are better than one. As college students we
      have to learn how to ask questions and learn from others. The only problem is that an ICS students is known to go
      lone wolf throughout their college career. The goal for us is to give ICS students an opportunity to connect to
      their peers in a quick and easy fashion. This app will allow students to quickly reserve a study time in the ICS
      space and notify a certain group of that session. We will also make sure that students do not meet poor study
      buddies. Never will a student have a bad study buddy and never will a student have to study alone!</h4>
